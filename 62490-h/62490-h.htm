<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>More and more people are turning to the outdoors and the enjoyment
of nature. Many great Americans have been students of wild
birds. This is not accidental, for few forms of outdoor recreation
offer so much pleasure.</p>
<p>The <i>season</i> of the year will in some cases determine what birds
are in your area. <i>Color</i> is important in identifying species. Look carefully
at the <i>silhouette</i> or <i>shape</i>; is it slender or chunky, is the tail
short or long? Compare its <i>size</i> with a bird with which you are more
familiar. <i>Habitat</i> is important, too. One learns to look for Red-winged
Blackbirds in wet marshes; for a meadowlark in pastures and fields.
<i>Behavior</i> is a clue. Does it walk or hop; does it soar, does it walk
headfirst down a tree, as is the habit of the nuthatch, or scratch
among leaves like the towhee? Listen to the bird&rsquo;s <i>song</i> and <i>call
note</i>. With a little experience, distinctive songs may be identified.
Each bird has its characteristic song.</p>
<p>Bird study can be pursued with as much effort as the watcher
cares to exert. Birds need food, water and protection from their
natural enemies. You can provide these in your own yard. Some
birds will be attracted and you can study them at your leisure. Other
species, those which live in swamps, for example, must be searched
for aggressively.</p>
<p>A bird guide is a splendid investment, considering the hours of
pleasure it will bring you. Binoculars are a help, too, in studying the
size, shape, beak, legs and color pattern.</p>
<p>Make written notes of what you see and hear, or a dated list of
species and numbers of each. Records will add to your own pleasure
and add to the sum of knowledge on birds in general.</p>
<p>This is the second booklet on common birds of the United States
published by Capper Publications, Inc. Each of the two volumes illustrates
and describes 50 different species. Additional copies (specify
whether volume I or II is desired) may be ordered for 25 cents each
as follows:</p>

<br /><i>Pelecanus erythrorhynchos</i></h3>

</div>
<p>Soaring overhead during migration, a flock of
White Pelicans is a magnificent sight. These
great birds weigh as much as 15 pounds, have a
wingspread of 9 feet and a total length of more
than 5 feet. Their legs are sturdy but short, the
toes fully webbed. The bill is long and flat with
a pouch beneath the lower mandible. Three contrasting
colors make this bird easily identified.
The bird is white except for the outer two-thirds
of the wings where the end and rear half
is black. The bill, pouch and feet are yellow or
reddish-yellow.</p>
<p>The head is carried well back, which rests the
bill and pouch on the shoulders. They float high
on the water and when surrounded by ducks and
grebes, they look like aircraft carriers with a
destroyer escort.</p>
<p>Unlike the smaller Brown Pelican, these birds
do not dive for their food, but form a line,
drive the fish to shallow water, where their
built-in landing nets ladle the small fry out of
the water. Many &ldquo;crawdads&rdquo; find that an open
pouch is no place to hide when these birds
wave their open beaks back and forth in shallow
water.</p>
<p>Pelicans must have originated the game of
&ldquo;follow the leader,&rdquo; for in flight, whatever the
leader does, each bird follows in turn.</p>

<br /><i>Leucophoyx thula</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="460" height="466" />
</div>
<p>Like ghosts from a bloody past, Snowy Egrets
have returned to add their beauty to American
bird life. Woman&rsquo;s vanity and man&rsquo;s desire for
money once brought these beautiful herons almost
to the point of extinction. The dainty recurved
plumes, which formed a part of the breeding
plumage of the birds, were known as &ldquo;cross
aigrettes,&rdquo; when they were sold by milliners.
Women bought, men slaughtered, and egrets
died, not only for the plumes; but the nestlings
starved after the adults were killed. Plume
hunters have departed and the birds are now
found in their favorite swamps.</p>
<p>This bird has a length of 20 to 25 inches,
white with black bill and legs. The feet are yellow,
giving it the nickname of &ldquo;the bird with
the golden slippers.&rdquo; The young of the Little
Blue Heron are also white but have greenish
legs, while the bill is 2-tone, blue with black tip.
The American Egret is much larger and shows
a yellow bill.</p>
<p>The Snowy Egret formerly nested in the Deep
South, but is gradually extending its range to
include more northern areas. They are prone to
wander widely after the breeding season. Western
birders will find the Brewster&rsquo;s Snowy Egret
in their area.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="401" height="423" />
</div>
<p>Anyone who spends time near a lake, pond or
stream will find this small heron, for it is there
that he secures the minnows, frogs and crayfish
which form the major portion of his diet.
His favorite method is to stand quietly on a
partly submerged log where fish are feeding
within reach of his long neck and bill. A quick
thrust and one course is served. At other times
you will see him sneaking carefully up to the
water&rsquo;s edge, where some slight ripple indicates
the movement of fish or frogs.</p>
<p>This bird is small, measuring only 16 to 22
inches in length, but appears even smaller until
he extends his long chestnut-colored neck. At a
distance he appears to be black but a closer view
shows a bluish or greenish tinge to the feathers,
depending on lighting conditions. His legs are
short and range from greenish to almost orange
in color, depending on the season.</p>
<p>The Green Heron builds a loosely-constructed
nest, usually not more than 20 feet above the
ground, but often some distance from water.
They are inclined to nest singly, but may form
loose colonies when abundant. The 3 to 5 eggs
are greenish in color and can usually be seen
thru the frail structure which these birds consider
home.</p>

<br /><i>Branta canadensis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="413" height="425" />
</div>
<p>There is something about the Canada Goose
that demands respect. Farmers see him as a
weather prophet for his fall flight indicates that
winter is on the way, while his spring migration
tells them that warmer days will follow. Hunters
see him as the prize game bird, worthy of
their best efforts. Others point to this bird as a
model for man, for his strength, courage and
fidelity leave little to be desired. Even the newsboy
stops selling papers to watch and listen as
these great birds pass over the cities.</p>
<p>Americans are fortunate, for at least one of
the 5 sub-species of Canada Geese is found in
all areas. They range from the Cackling Goose,
a small dark sub-species not much larger than
a Mallard and weighing around 3 pounds, to the
huge Western Canada and the Common Canada
with weights of 10 pounds or more. Richardson&rsquo;s
Goose at 4 pounds and the Lesser Canada at 5
pounds are two smaller sub-species both lighter
in plumage like the Common Canada.</p>
<p>All show the same pattern: black head, neck,
tail, feet and bill with a white cheek patch and
light belly. Back and wings are brownish-gray.
The cheek patch in most types is joined beneath
the chin. The white of the belly extends around
the tail, making the black tail feathers distinctive.
The gray shows a barred effect.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Anas acuta</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="485" height="510" />
</div>
<p>This duck has the widest nesting range of any
species in the northern hemisphere. An American
Pintail looks much the same whether you
find him in Hawaii, Europe, Asia, Alaska, Canada,
Mexico or on either coast of the United
States. The drake is a large gray-backed, white-breasted
duck. The white of the breast extends
up the long neck to a point back of the brown
head; gray feathers extend up the back of the
neck to the head. The tail gives a clue to the
name, for the 2 center feathers are long, black
and pointed. The female is a mottled brown and
shows a long, thin neck, bluish-gray feet and
a pointed but not elongated tail.</p>
<p>These birds are strong fliers and do much of
their courting on the wing, the female leading
a convoy of males, each trying to outdo the
others. Perhaps she chooses the strongest flier
for her mate. The male has a whistled note while
the female utters a muffled quack.</p>
<p>Pintails feed in shallow water where their
long necks give them some advantage over the
shorter-necked puddle ducks which enjoy the
same habitat. Nests are placed on dry ground
and are usually a deep hollow lined with grasses
and down. The site is variable and might be
near or far from water, but the American Pintail
will go all out to protect her young.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="491" height="603" />
</div>
<p>Some people call this bird the &ldquo;Summer
Duck.&rdquo; The fact he arrives late in spring and
departs for his winter home before the heavy
frosts indicates a desire to evade cold weather.
Most of these ducks are well on their way to
Mexico or South America when other species
begin to arrive from the nesting grounds. Early
migration saves the lives of many Blue-wings
for hunters prefer this duck for eating. Their
speedy flight, their erratic twisting and turning,
their tendency to decoy&mdash;all offer a challenge
to the nimrod.</p>
<p>The blue wing patch, from which this duck
derives its name, also is shared by the Cinnamon
Teal which replaces this bird in western areas.
Shovellers also carry a similar marking. The
reddish color of the male Cinnamon Teal and
the huge bill of the Shoveller help distinguish
the birds. In the eclipse plumage, both male and
female Blue-wings are much alike, but by the
latter part of October the male assumes the
dark head and tail, a crescent before the eye,
brown speckled body, back gray-brown, white
patch on each flank with dull yellow feet. The
bill is bluish-black. The female is brownish-gray
in all plumages. Both sexes show the blue
wing patch in any plumage.</p>

<br /><i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="416" height="401" />
</div>
<p>This little duck is known by almost 100 different
names in the areas where he is found.
But no matter what you call him or where you
find him, he is distinctive. No other duck except
the Masked Duck, which is found in the West
Indies, has the stiff tail which often is carried
erect and fanned like a miniature sail. The male
has a black or blackish-brown crown and nape,
depending on the season, whether breeding or
winter. The bright-blue bill, rich reddish-chestnut
body and white cheek patch make the male
a beautiful bird in breeding plumage. In winger
the male assumes the grayish-brown coloring of
the female, both showing the light cheek patch
with darker crown and nape. The head, neck and
feet are large for so small a bird.</p>
<p>These ducks are much like grebes in that they
can dive or sink into the water, are almost helpless
on land, and patter some distance over the
water before taking into the air.</p>
<p>Ruddy ducks conceal their nests in reeds or
bulrushes over water. Eggs are larger than one
would expect to find from so small a mother.
The male, unlike most ducks, seems proud to
lead his little family on their quest for food and
remains near while the female incubates.</p>
<p>Everything about a Ruddy sets him apart
from other ducks.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No matter what you call him</p>

<br /><i>Mergus merganser</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="408" height="435" />
</div>
<p>Many birds have developed beaks which help
them secure their food. The American Merganser
is no exception. His beak is long and narrow
and both mandibles are edged with sharp,
pointed teeth which are inclined backward. The
tip is covered by a nail or hook designed for
catching and holding fish which form the major
portion of this duck&rsquo;s food. These birds are expert
divers and the entire flock soon joins one
of its members which has located a school of
fish. Both rough and game fish are relished.</p>
<p>The male is a beautiful bird with his red bill,
greenish-black head, black back fading to an
ashy-gray rump and tail. The chest, sides and
breast are white and often show a pinkish-salmon
tint. Wings show a black and white pattern
and the feet are red. A large streamlined duck
sitting low in the water with a white body and
black trim is descriptive. The female has a reddish-brown
head with an elongated brushy crest,
ashy-gray back and white belly. They can be
confused only with the Red-breasted Merganser,
but in this case, both male and female are
crested and the male shows a white collar and
reddish upper chest.</p>
<p>American Mergansers are rugged and linger
as far north as open water will permit securing
of food.</p>

<br /><i>Circus cyaneus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="463" height="497" />
</div>
<p>The Marsh Hawk is often called &ldquo;Harrier,&rdquo;
and his method of hunting would justify such a
name. They cover a field like a well-trained dog,
back and forth, here and there, cruising slowly
with a deliberate flap or a slow sail on wings
tipped a little above the horizontal. A slight
movement, a quick pounce, and another field
mouse has joined his ancestors. The white rump
patch makes a good field mark, either on the
gray-plumaged male or the brownish feathers
of the female or young. The long wings and tail
make these birds appear larger than their
length of 19 to 22 inches.</p>
<p>Marsh Hawks feed heavily on rodents but include
insects, frogs or birds in the diet. Dead
animals or birds are not overlooked, thus causing
the Marsh Hawk to be blamed for kills
which he did not make.</p>
<p>Harriers seem to take pleasure in diving at
each other, and the larger buteos, eagles, vultures,
prairie chickens or flocks of ducks.</p>
<p>Nests are placed on the ground and are hidden
by shrubs, weeds or marshy growth. The female
spends much of her time with or near the young
while the male is kept busy hunting food for his
growing family. The usual clutch contains 5
white or pale-blue eggs, lightly marked with
brown spots.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="386" height="566" />
</div>
<p>This chunky little brown quail is popular in
every region where he resides. Hunters spend
thousands of dollars each year in pursuit of this
feathered bombshell. Farmers appreciate having
such an active ally in their fight against the
hordes of insects which menace their crops.
They enjoy hearing his cheerful whistle as they
go about their daily chores. Birders are happy
to know this is one bird which offers no problem
for they can list him by either sight or sound.
Anyone can point with pride to this bird&rsquo;s good
character for the male can, and often does, take
charge of the brood, teaching them how to exist
in a hostile world.</p>
<p>The male shows a white throat and line over
the eye, while the female is content to wear
buffy feathers which make her only a little
less colorful. Bobwhites nest and roost on the
ground and will spend their entire lives in a
limited area if shelter, food and water are available.
Many farmers co-operate with their little
neighbors by planting blackberries, multiflora
rose, or raspberries along their fences, not farming
the last inch of every corner of the field.
Some even leave a little milo or other grain unharvested
near the edge of their fields. Such
practices pay dividends in the harvest of insects
consumed by Bobwhites.</p>

<br /><i>Capella gallinago</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="447" height="505" />
</div>
<p>Wilson&rsquo;s Snipe, frequently known as a &ldquo;Jack
Snipe,&rdquo; is the most common of 3 species which
have extremely long, straight bills. All feed by
probing in soft mud where their sensitive bills
soon locate and obtain their food. This bird
prefers marshy areas near streams or ponds.
When disturbed, he leaves the scene so rapidly
that you might miss the erratic, zig-zag flight,
the pointed wings, the stripes on his head, the
brownish-striped plumage. You might even
miss the orange tail, but you probably will hear
the rasping note which he usually utters when
he departs. The Woodcock, a similar species,
feeds in dense cover and has bars across his
crown, rounded wings and a chunky build. A
third long-billed bird is the Dowitcher, which
feeds in open, shallow water and is found often
in small flocks.</p>
<p>Many birds are noted for unusual sounds
which they make. Wilson&rsquo;s Snipe is no exception;
however in his case it is not a vocal effort
for he ranks low as a singer. This bird uses a
flight pattern which causes a vibration of feathers
as the bird plunges diagonally downward.
Observers have noticed the 2 outer feathers of
the tail seem to be separated while on such
flights; perhaps this is the clue to the unusual
sound.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Bartramia longicauda</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="434" height="548" />
</div>
<p>The Upland Plover is a confusing bird. Ornithologists
still are arguing about what he should
be called&mdash;a sandpiper or a plover. He formerly
was known as a Bartramian Sandpiper. Now the
trend seems to indicate that Upland Sandpiper
is a name which fits his habits better than Upland
Plover. Altho he has legs long enough for
wading, he uses them for traveling thru grasses,
not water. When alighting, he holds his wings
up momentarily before folding them; in fact
most of his actions seem more like a plover.
Whatever you call him, he still will be found
on prairies and grasslands; marshes and mud
flats have no appeal to this bird.</p>
<p>The Upland Plover is slightly larger than a
Killdeer and is buffy brown in color. His long
neck, small head with rather short beak, long
tail, hovering flight, but most of all his prolonged
call, make identification easy. His long-drawn,
mournful whistle seems to blend with
breezes which blow above the prairies, and once
heard, is not easily forgotten.</p>
<p>These birds once were scarce due to heavy
shooting by market hunters, who slaughtered
them in great numbers. They now are protected
in much of their range, but unfortunately this
protection does not extend to their winter home
in South America.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="459" height="470" />
</div>
<p>Sandpipers can be confusing, especially in fall
plumage. Mixed flocks require special checking
even by experts, but not the Greater Yellow-legs.
His large size, slender build, yellow legs,
gray upper parts, white tail coverts and under
parts can be confused only with the Lesser Yellow-legs
(Totanus flavipes). When together,
there is no problem for the latter measures 9&frac12;
to 11 inches while the Greater Yellow-legs runs
from 13 to 15 inches in length. The small, slim
beak of the Lesser is straight, whereas the
heavier bill of the Greater seems to be slightly
upturned. The call is different, for the larger
bird uses a loud 3 or 4 note whistle. The smaller
uses less volume in his 1 or 2 note effort.</p>
<p>This sandpiper prefers mud flats and his long
legs permit him to feed in deeper water where
he adds minnows and crayfish to his diet. He can
swallow small fish but occasionally lands one
which must be reduced to bite size. However,
the bird is persistent and soon completes his
meal.</p>
<p>The Greater Yellow-legs migrates thruout the
United States and may be seen around any suitable
habitat. It nests as far north as Alaska and
Labrador and may winter far into South America;
however many remain along our southern
shores and bayous.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="420" height="506" />
</div>
<p>The black and white plumage of this medium-size
shore bird is distinctive. A closer inspection
will show long, blue legs, a thin, upturned bill
and in breeding plumage, a rusty neck and head
with white before the eye. In winter, the rusty
markings are replaced by a gray wash. European
birds lack the colorful neck and head markings,
but show the black and white pattern and
often are called Awl-birds. The bill gives the
clue to such a name.</p>
<p>The Avocet feeds by wading in shallow water
and swinging his bill back and forth; flocks
often advance and feed in unison. These birds
also are capable swimmers and have been observed
while feeding like puddle ducks, tipping
up and extending their heads far under water
in search of insects and small crustacea.</p>
<p>Avocets formerly nested as far east as New
Jersey but now favor the shores of ponds, lakes
and sloughs in the western areas. Sun-dried mud
or alkaline flats often bring loose colonies of
these birds, anywhere from Southern Texas
to Alberta and British Columbia. When disturbed,
they circle overhead, utter a series of yelping
calls or feign a broken wing in order to lure you
away from their nesting sites.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="407" height="446" />
</div>
<p>Phalaropes are unique. Unlike most birds, the
female is more colorful, does most of the courting,
leaves nest building, incubating and rearing
of young to the long-suffering male. Her lone
contribution to the rearing of the family is laying
eggs. She does deserve some credit, however,
for she remains in the area and will join
the male in circling overhead when the nest is
disturbed, both uttering a sort of nasal, trumpet-like
toot.</p>
<p>Wilson&rsquo;s Phalarope is not only the largest
phalarope, but prefers inland marshes, while the
Red Phalarope and Northern Phalarope spend
more time at sea. In breeding plumage, the female
shows a distinctive black line down the
side of the neck, starting in front of the eye and
blending into a chestnut wash on the shoulders.
Under parts and throat are white, wings gray
with a gray line extending thru the cinnamon
buff of the back. The male is grayer with a cinnamon
wash on the neck. In fall, both birds
show dark wings, white rump patch and light
plumage. The long, needle-like bill and the
whirling motion when swimming are good clues
to identification in any season. When feeding in
shallow water, these birds are active, always in
a hurry and running from place to place.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="452" height="582" />
</div>
<p>Audubon, in 1840, referred to this species as
the common American gull, but due to the
change in habitat and increase in population,
these birds have departed from many of their
former nesting areas. However, next to the
larger Herring Gull, it still is one of the most
widely distributed. These birds form breeding
colonies on islands in Northern United States
and Southern Canada, often sharing these sites
with the Cormorant and the Common Tern. Like
other gulls, they are not to be trusted around
unprotected nests of other species, for eggs are
considered quite a delicacy in a gull&rsquo;s diet.</p>
<p>The black ring near the end of this bird&rsquo;s bill
is not a good field mark unless you are near or
use powerful glasses to check the specimen. It
looks much like a Herring Gull, except for the
smaller size (18-20 inches), as compared with
the 23-26 inches of the Herring Gull. The Ring-billed
shows greenish-yellow legs, whereas the
Herring has flesh-colored ones. Both birds show
a gray mantle with black wing tips surrounding
a white spot. The Herring shows a little more
white in this respect. Young of the Ring-billed
are a lighter buff than most other species and
show a black band near the end of the tail.</p>

</div>
<p>The Great Horned Owl, largest of the eared
owls, is found over a wide area and may be
either light or dark in color, depending on the
area where he is found. All specimens show a
white throat, ear tufts and yellow eyes. This
bird is almost 2 feet in length and can handle
fair-sized animals when pressed by hunger. The
hoot of this bird is deeper, slower and more
uniform than that of the Barred Owl, and often
can be heard as a sort of conversational note
between 2 birds in the same area. It is given as
a 2-note &ldquo;Who-who,&rdquo; and answered by a similar
call from another bird some distance away.
These calls are given on a different pitch.</p>
<p>These owls nest early and often use old structures
which were built by hawks, crows or
eagles. Hollow trees or stone ledges furnish desirable
locations. They are good parents and
defend their home and young against all comers,
including men. Crows and jays take delight in
heckling these owls, but are careful to keep a
safe distance, for Great Horned Owls see well
in bright sunlight, altho they do most of their
hunting in darkness. Their diet includes almost
any type of animal life available, but rabbits,
rats, squirrels and mice seem to be preferred.
Some feed on starlings and pigeons which they
find around city buildings.</p>

<p>People once called this bird a Yellow-hammer.
Lots of folks still do, and it&rsquo;s but one of the

His brown-barred back, black crescent
on the throat, spotted breast, white rump patch
and bounding flight, his large size, his loud
drumming, his posturing and his loud calls all
point to this bird or, if you live in the west, the
Red-shafted Flicker. The latter shows a reddish
tint to the wings and tail where this bird
shows yellow. Heads of males are marked differently,
in that the western bird shows a red
line extending down from the mouth, while the
Yellow-shafted shows black lines.</p>
<p>A flicker prefers ants to any other food, and
nature has equipped him with a long, sticky
tongue which permits him to explore anthills
or tunnels in trees where these insects might
be lurking. When ants are not available, he
turns to other insects, fruit or berries, one of his
favorites the seeds of the poison ivy.</p>
<p>Flickers usually excavate their homes in the
trunks of dead trees, the entrance about 3 inches
across and extending downward to as much as
24 inches. Both birds apply themselves to this
task, leaving small bits of wood in the bottom
in lieu of other nesting material.</p>

<br /><i>Centurus carolinus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="403" height="460" />
</div>
<p>If you look for a red belly on this bird, you
might miss him entirely. Look instead for the
red crown and nape, the heavily-barred back
and wings and grayish-white under parts. The
female lacks the red crown, only the nape showing
this brilliant coloring. These birds are about
the same size as Hairy Woodpeckers (9 to 10&frac12;
inches) and are rather shy, spending much of
their time in wooded areas. Bird feeders supplied
with corn and nut meats with ample pieces
of suet will bring them to your yard. Their
natural food consists of beetles and other insects,
together with a generous helping of wild
fruits, seeds, acorns and when available, some
corn. It also relishes both juice and pulp of
oranges.</p>
<p>Like other woodpeckers, the Red-bellied excavates
nesting holes in trees where their 3 to
5 eggs are laid. Starlings often are waiting to
take over these newly-constructed homes and
form a real menace to these hard-working birds.</p>
<p>Red-bellied Woodpeckers seem to be permanent
residents in suitable locations, not migrating
like flickers and Red-headed Woodpeckers.
However, they usually are more common in
southern areas with a northern limit of Southern
Minnesota and Delaware.</p>

</div>
<p>If all birds wore contrasting colors like the
Red-headed Woodpecker, identifying birds would
be easy. You just can&rsquo;t miss on this one&mdash;the
red head and neck, white under parts, blue-black
back and tail, black wings with a broad white
patch. The young show a grayish-brown head
but the white wing patch gives you the clue.</p>
<p>These beautiful birds once were common and
nested from the Gulf of Mexico to the southern
edge of some Canadian provinces. Recent years
have shown a decline in their numbers, probably
due to Starlings taking over their nesting
cavities before the woodpeckers can rear their
broods. Another factor is their destruction by
speeding automobiles. These birds feed on flying
insects, and often drop down on our highways
in pursuit of grasshoppers. Motor cars and
some drivers have no respect for wildlife, no
matter how beautiful or beneficial.</p>
<p>Beechnuts, acorns, pecans and various fruits
and berries are consumed in quantity, and a
good supply often will hold these birds far north
of their usual winter range. Most Red-headed
Woodpeckers migrate, and like flickers, sometimes
fly at night, as both species have been
recovered after hitting television towers.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="288" height="484" />
</div>
<p>Flycatchers can be, and often are, noisy birds.
They seem to enjoy life and want the world to
know how they feel about it. The Crested Flycatcher
is no exception. To hear this bird at his
best, stroll quietly thru some heavily-wooded
area. You scarcely are aware of the flute-like
tones of the Wood Thrush in the distance, drum
of the Downy Woodpecker, the bubbling tones
of the Carolina Wren. All is serene. Suddenly a
loudly-whistled &ldquo;wheeep,&rdquo; followed by a series
of equally loud rolling notes, shatters the air.
That is the Crested Flycatcher.</p>
<p>You might see him sitting quietly, peering intently
at every leaf and branch, slowly moving
his head so nothing will be missed. Then you
will see the rufous tail, yellow belly, olive head
and back, grayish throat and 2 wing bars. You
might see the slight crest from which he gets
his name. He is a trim bird almost robin size.</p>
<p>These flycatchers will nest in most any type
of hole or cavity, even bird houses when available.
They prefer heavily-wooded areas. They
have the habit of using snakeskins either in the
nesting material or draped into the entrance.
Perhaps it makes them feel secure. Since Americans
are prone to leave wax paper and cellophane
around picnic areas, these birds find such
materials a good substitute for snakeskins.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Contopus virens</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="317" height="456" />
</div>
<p>Some early morning in May, when the trees
are filled with migrants, take a stroll thru the
woods! The world is filled with bird notes and
you listen to the symphony of sound. Then you
hear a questioning whisper &ldquo;pee-a-wee,&rdquo; as if
some stranger wondered if he should or could
make himself heard. Finally you locate the bird
with the plaintive note and find a little flycatcher,
but since he is sitting on a well-shaded
limb, you have trouble with the markings. Eventually
you see that he is about sparrow-size, is
a dusky olive-brown above with whitish under
parts, lacks an eye ring but shows 2 distinct
wing bars. That is the Eastern Wood Pewee.</p>
<p>Western observers will find the Western Wood
Pewee to be a bird with nearly the same markings
and habits. However, the western bird has
a more nasal, single note song. Tho both birds
place their nests on tops of limbs, the Eastern
Wood Pewee builds a shallower structure, well
covered with lichens and cobwebs, giving it the
appearance of a knot on the limb. Both nest in
rather open situations. Both birds feed heavily
on insects and spiders, including many harmful
weevils, flies and beetles. Unfortunately they
draw no distinction between useful parasites
and pests.</p>

<br /><i>Iridoprocne bicolor</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="380" height="478" />
</div>
<p>The frost hardly has left the ground, or the
peepers and cricket frogs assembled their
chorus, when flocks of these swallows can be
seen winging their way northward. First flights
include only the rugged males which arrive well
in advance of their mates. They also are one of
the last species of swallows to migrate in the
fall. These birds show whitish under parts, while
the upper parts are a greenish steel-blue. Western
observers might confuse this bird with the
Violet-green Swallow but remember that the
latter shows a conspicuous white patch on each
side of the rump.</p>
<p>Tree Swallows prefer a location near water
and soon will occupy holes in stumps so located:
however, bird houses are acceptable. They do
not choose to nest in colonies and will defend
their nesting site with vigor. Those who erect
nesting boxes for these swallows might find it
necessary to help them evict House Sparrows
which often take a liking to their homes. Flying
insects form the major portion of this bird&rsquo;s
food. These include numerous mosquitoes and
other insects which hatch on or near water, for
that seems to be their favorite feeding ground.
Other foods include bayberry and wax myrtle
berries, which are sought during migration.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="384" height="384" />
</div>
<p>Cliff Swallows may be found in almost any
part of North America but the west offers more
overhanging cliffs where they assemble in large
colonies. Their one requirement is an ample
supply of mud for their use in building the jug-shaped
structure which they attach to buildings,
under bridges or overhanging cliffs. Mud reinforced
with a few straws, makes a sturdy home,
and when lined with feathers, what more could
a Cliff Swallow want? House Sparrows also
find these little adobe houses inviting, but are
not popular neighbors.</p>
<p>This species is easily recognized by the buffy
rump patch. Other markings include: a dull
white patch above the bill, crown and back of
head blue-black, nape brownish gray, back blue-black
striped with gray, chestnut over cheek
and eye, black patch on lower throat, with chest
flanks and sides grayish-brown with rest of
under parts white. These birds show more of an
assortment of colors than other species.</p>
<p>It is interesting to watch these birds gathering
mud for their nests. Always they hold their
wings high above their backs and trip daintily
around until they get a mouthful of mud, but
hesitate to get either their feet wet or their
wings soiled.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="375" height="475" />
</div>
<p>Nuthatches are one of the few &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo;
birds. Chickadees and titmice sometimes feed
by hanging below a cone or some limb which
they want to explore; woodpeckers and Brown
Creepers may brace themselves beneath a limb,
but nuthatches seem to feel more at ease, when
coming down a tree headfirst. That must be an
advantage for they may see food which the
climbers overlook. It is amazing to see the ease
with which they travel, never using their tails
as props.</p>
<p>The White-breasted Nuthatch, largest of the
family, is about sparrow-size (6 inches), and
shows a bluish-gray back, white under parts
with blackish crown and nape. Beady black eyes
are noticeable since they are surrounded by the
white cheeks. These birds seem to favor deciduous
trees rather than evergreens, the preferred
habitat of the smaller Red-breasted Nuthatch.</p>
<p>A supply of nut meats and suet on your feeder
seems to attract these birds. You might decide,
after watching them for a short time, that such
a small bird could not eat such a quantity of
food. A further check will show that he is
thrifty, making trip after trip to hide choice
morsels for future use. He is never sure how
long the supply will last.</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>Americans are fortunate. There are a lot of
reasons, but one is the fact that we have several
species of wrens. There is something about these
birds that demands immediate attention. It
might be their size, for most are small. It might
be their songs, for most are good singers. It
might be their trim, sleek-looking jauntiness&mdash;some
might even call it cockiness. These birds
are popular around mansions or weather-beaten
shacks.</p>
<p>For those of us who live south of the area of
severe winters, and east of the plains, the Carolina
Wren might be classed as a favorite bird.
Any wooded area, especially one with small
streams running thru it, makes ideal habitat
for this songster. The more tangles and brushy
undergrowth, the better he will like it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t happen to recognize any of his
numerous songs, his size and coloring will lead
to his identity. He is as large as a small sparrow
(5&frac12; to 6 inches), rufous red above with buffy
under parts. He shows a white line over the eye
and faint wing bars. The Bewick&rsquo;s Wrens and
Long-billed Marsh Wrens show a line over the
eye, both are smaller. Bewick&rsquo;s has white tips
on the tail feathers, while the latter shows distinct
stripes down the back.</p>

<br /><i>Toxostoma rufum</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="398" height="510" />
</div>
<p>This long-tailed bird (with the rufous-brown
color, white wing bars, curved bill, striped
breast and yellow eyes) welcomes spring with a
loud and cheerful song. You will see him sitting
at the top of some tall tree, throwing all his
efforts into loud, clear notes. You will notice a
wide variety of tones but all seem to run to
couplets and triplets, not like the steady tempo
of the Mockingbird or the more subdued tones
of the Catbird, both of which are near relatives.</p>
<p>The next time you see him, he is likely to be
under a hedge or around a brushy area, busily
engaged in moving any leaves or other rubbish
which might hide a lurking insect. Another favorite
habitat is along the less-traveled country
roads, where he always seems to think he should
be on the opposite side and makes a quick, running
flight to get there.</p>
<p>Brown Thrashers are found in suitable habitat
anywhere east of the Rocky Mountains and
sometimes spend the winter far north of their
usual southern range. Sennett&rsquo;s Thrasher is
similar but is found in the southern parts of
Texas. Brown Thrashers are often called &ldquo;Brown
Thrushes,&rdquo; but thrushes have short tails, a different
type of song, and prefer a different habitat.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Hylocichla mustelina</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="450" height="537" />
</div>
<p>To know the Wood Thrush is to love him. Unfortunately
he seldom visits cities unless parks
or other heavily-wooded areas are found within
the borders. Forests, with a plentiful undercover,
offer the seclusion which this bird demands.
There you will hear the flute-like tones
which make this bird famous as a singer. It is
not a continued effort; each series of notes is
followed by a rest, allowing you to absorb the
full beauty of the rounded tones&mdash;then another,
but completely different series, sometimes
higher, sometimes lower, but always the
same pure quality. Some think the Hermit
Thrush is a better singer, but the Wood Thrush
is a close competitor.</p>
<p>When you invade his domain he will greet
you with a series of scolding notes, but that
gives you a chance to see him. You will notice
he is slightly smaller than a Robin, has a heavily-spotted
breast and a rufous head, the back
wings and tail more of a reddish cinnamon-brown.
They nest rather low and use either mud
or leaf mold in building a sturdy structure. This
is an eastern bird but ranges from Minnesota,
Ontario and New Hampshire south almost to
the Gulf. A few winter around the Gulf of Mexico
but most prefer the more southern areas of
Mexico, Central America and Panama.</p>

</div>
<p>The Olive-backed Thrush and the Gray-cheeked
Thrush are similar. Both show olive-brown
backs, light under parts and lighter spots
than the Wood Thrush. The Olive-backed is
slightly smaller and shows a more distinct
eye ring, buffier cheeks and breast. This bird&rsquo;s
song is a series of flute-like tones which spiral
upward. A. D. DuBois (M.S. quoted by Bent in
Bulletin 196-1949-P. 184) thinks of it as saying
&ldquo;whip-poor-will-a-will-a-zee-zee-zee.&rdquo; The
Veery&rsquo;s song starts high and runs down the
scale, while the Gray-cheeked Thrush&rsquo;s song,
tho similar in quality, shows less variation and
ends on a slightly higher note.</p>
<p>Except a narrow range west of the Cascades
and Sierra Nevada mountains, occupied by a
western race, the Russet-backed Thrush, Olive-backs
can be found from Northern North America
to Central South America, depending on the
season of the year. One of the nice things about
this bird is that he sings during migration, giving
bird lovers a chance to hear his song without
traveling to the land of spruce, fir and birch,
which is a favorite nesting area.</p>
<p>More than 63 per cent of this bird&rsquo;s food is
animal matter and includes many beetles. Wild,
soft-skinned fruits with occasional seeds complete
the diet.</p>

<img src="images/p08d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="326" height="499" />
</div>
<p>This tiny bird, smaller than a chickadee,
never seems to have a quiet moment. On first
sight, one is reminded of a Mockingbird, but
not from his color, for he is blue-gray above
and whitish below. It might be the long tail
with the black center and white sides or perhaps
it is the trim build. There is a narrow,
white eye ring, and the male shows a dark line
above the bill. These marks are sometimes difficult
to see due to the bird&rsquo;s restlessness. The
tail seems to be constantly in motion. Both birds
utter call notes, a thin &ldquo;spee&rdquo; or &ldquo;zpee&rdquo; sound.
His song itself is faint and seldom heard.</p>
<p>These birds range from Southern Canada to
Guatemala and are permanent residents in some
states bordering the Gulf, but sporadic in their
northern range.</p>
<p>The Gnatcatcher is an early migrant and can
be found well into his nesting range by the middle
of April. Nests sometimes are constructed
in advance of egg-laying dates. Perhaps the
bird is taking advantage of a supply of building
materials which are seasonal. It frequently dismantles
the first nest, using the contents in the
construction of another nest in a more favorable
location. It is built of plant down and other materials,
bound with webs and covered with lichens.</p>

<p>When you hear this bird sing, you are impressed
by the beauty of clear, but variable
notes. When you check the source, you are surprised
to see a tiny bird with such a big voice.
His short tail might lead you to believe he is
even smaller than the 3&frac34; to 4&frac12; inches which
he measures. His coloring is not impressive,
being an olive-gray. You might notice the distinct
eye ring or the prominent wing bars. If he
is excited by your close inspection, he might
flash the ruby crown feathers, from which he
gets his name.</p>
<p>In fall you might think this bird was a warbler
for he has some of the warbler actions. He
constantly flicks his wings and tail in a nervous
manner, but you will miss the tail markings of
the warblers. The Golden-crowned Kinglet is
similar in size and general markings, but both
male and female show distinctive gold crown
patches. The Golden-crowned seems a little
more rugged and spends his winters farther
north.</p>
<p>These birds nest in the spruce belt of Canada
and spend the winter in Southern United States
with scattering records as far north as Iowa.
The Western Ruby-crowned Kinglet is similar
in appearance but has a slightly different song.
It frequently nests as far south as New Mexico.</p>

</div>
<p>Waxwings are the nomads of the bird world;
like gypsies, they come and go. Apparently they
drift southward in the fall and northward in the
spring, but have no regular migration. They
range from Southern Canada to Central America
but might leave when it frosts or stay thru
the winter. Unlike some &ldquo;Knights of the Road,&rdquo;
they present a neat appearance. In fact the
soft, brownish-gray plumage, fading into lighter
under parts, the slate-colored tail with the yellow
tip, the jaunty crest, the black eye mask,
the reddish spot on the wing, the sleek, streamlined
stance&mdash;all mark him as an aristocrat.</p>
<p>Waxwings like companions and travel in
flocks. Where you find one, you might find a
dozen or more than one hundred. Whether feeding
or resting, you will hear them conversing
in a high-pitched, wheezy note which is difficult
to describe. Some refer to it as a hiss, others as
a whine.</p>
<p>When an ample supply of food is available,
Cedar Waxwings gorge themselves until they
seem rather listless. Various fruits and berries
are relished, but insects and cankerworms are
taken in season.</p>
<p>The Bohemian Waxwing is slightly larger,
grayer and shows more white on the wing and

</div>
<p>The Warbling Vireo is not colorful. If you happen
to see his back, you will see he is a grayish
olive-green, slightly grayer on the head. When
looked at from below, and that is the way you
generally see him, you may see a tinge of yellow
on the white under parts. A white line over
the eye is the only other marking. But don&rsquo;t give
up; you will note the slow, deliberate vireo
movement. He loves to sing and soon you will
hear a pleasing series of notes, all connected
but each note on a different pitch; a wave of
bird notes, not hurried but clear and musical.
This song could be confused with that of the
Purple Finch but the latter is slightly higher in
pitch and faster.</p>
<p>Unlike other vireos, he likes to nest in the
high, deciduous trees which line the streets of
cities and towns. Parks and farm homes also
offer suitable habitat. The nest is a neat structure,
placed near the end of a drooping branch
on some well-developed tree; one which is growing
in the open, for these small birds like plenty
of room around their homes. The male is so
proud of his home he often sings while taking
his turn with the incubating.</p>
<p>The Western Warbling Vireo has a similar
song, seems inclined to nest nearer the ground,
but shuns evergreens.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="491" height="693" />
</div>
<p>Warblers are an unusual family of birds.
Some act like flycatchers and often feed on flying
insects. Others join the vireos in searching
for larvae in the thick foliage of higher trees.
A few mingle with sandpipers and find their
food along the banks of some small stream,
while the ground-dwelling contingent share
choice morsels with thrushes. The Black and
White Warbler is different, for while nesting on
or near the ground, he feeds on the trunk or
larger limbs of trees, combining the upward
movement of the Brown Creeper with reverse
actions of nuthatches. His is more of a swing
movement, quickly switching as if undecided
whether to go up or down. Various beetles, ants,
weevils, plant lice and larvae are included in
his diet.</p>
<p>This bird can be distinguished from the similar
Black-polled Warbler by the white stripe
down the center of the crown and the white line
over the eye. Their habits and songs are different.</p>
<p>Due to its feeding habits, the Black and White
Warbler does not depend on extensive foliage to

earlier than many of this colorful family. Fall
migration may find him lingering well into October,
before departing for his winter home.</p>

<br /><i>Dendroica petechia</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="462" height="694" />
</div>
<p>The Yellow Warbler, commonly called &ldquo;Wild
Canary,&rdquo; is the best-known member of the
warbler family. Its breeding range extends from
the northern part of Alaska, thru Canada,
United States and into Mexico, and from coast
to coast. It winters as far south as Peru. Unlike
most warblers, this friendly little bird seems to
enjoy being near people and may nest in some
shrub or bush near your home.</p>
<p>You will recognize him instantly for he is the
yellowest of all our warblers, even in confusing
fall plumage. The male shows pale, chestnut
streaks on the throat, breast and sides. The female
may show a few obscure markings, but
not the distinct pattern worn by her mate.</p>
<p>Yellow Warblers build a compact little nest
using grasses, plant down, wool, cotton, hair
or feathers, depending on available materials.
Nests range from 3 to 60 feet above ground,
with a tendency to build them low when suitable
sites are found. Cowbirds are this bird&rsquo;s worst
enemy for one or more Cowbird eggs can be
found in most Yellow Warbler nests. They have
learned to combat this menace by adding another
story to their structure, thereby covering
unwanted eggs with a new layer of nesting material.
In some instances as many as 6 stories
have been added.</p>

<h3 id="c37">Northern Water-thrush
<br /><i>Seiurus noveboracensis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="602" height="500" />
</div>
<p>It is easy to see why these warblers are called
water-thrushes. They resemble thrushes and
usually are found near water. When you see him
walking down a half-submerged log or wading
along the edges of a pool, you will find he teeters
like a Spotted Sandpiper. You also will notice
the dark, olive-brown back, yellowish stripe
over the eye, the throat and under parts buffy-yellow
streaked with dark olive. The slightly
larger Louisiana Water-thrush shows a white
line over the eye, white or buffy-white under
parts, unmarked white throat with duller
streaks under the body. The Ovenbird, a near
relative, shows an eye ring, reddish-orange
crown and lacks the line over the eye. Western
observers will find that Grinnell&rsquo;s Water-thrush
is slightly larger with lighter eye lines and
under parts.</p>
<p>During migration, the Northern Water-thrush
might appear in your yard or garden, but edges
of swamps, ponds or streams appeal to him
most. To see him at his best it is necessary to
invade secluded areas around cool bogs, mountain
streams or northern lakes. There you will
hear the loud song, a series of clear but emphatic
notes. His well-hidden nest may be found
by stumps or roots or moss-covered logs.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This funny little warbler</p>
<p class="t0">Likes water on his feet,</p>
<p class="t0">And when it comes to singing</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s really hard to beat.</p>

<h3 id="c38">Yellow-breasted Chat
<br /><i>Icteria virens</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="543" height="711" />
</div>
<p>The Yellow-breasted Chat is not only the
largest, but the most unwarbler-like of this colorful
family. If you live near thickets of dense
shrubbery, where brier tangles and brushy, low
bushes grow in profusion, there you will find
this bird. He prefers low, damp ground but does
not overlook similar habitat on dry hillsides.
His loud and varied song will let you know when
he arrives. Each series of notes is followed by a
long pause, and then another series, but on an
entirely different pitch; clear-whistled notes,
low grating tones, caws or reed-like tones all
find a place in this bird&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>When you invade his territory, you will find
he is elusive, but a little patient waiting on your
part will bring him out. Then you can check the
olive-brown back and rich, lemon-yellow breast
fading to white beneath the tail. The white line
just above the eye combines with an eye ring,
as if he were wearing spectacles. You might
even see the short, stout bill or the rounded
wings. Its long tail gives this bird a length of
7&frac12; inches. He might entertain you with his
clown-like antics by fluttering into the air with
his head down and feet dangling, but accompanied
by some of his sweetest music.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A clown at heart,</p>
<p class="t0">He lets you know</p>
<p class="t0">That he is pleased</p>

<h3 id="c39">Wilson&rsquo;s Warbler
<br /><i>Wilsonia pusilla</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="482" height="591" />
</div>
<p>When you make this bird&rsquo;s acquaintance, you
will wonder why he was not called a &ldquo;Black-capped
Warbler,&rdquo; for no name would be more
fitting. In fact, many ornithologists now refer
to him by that name. Those who do their birding
in the Western United States might feel the
same about the Pileolated Warbler, which is
similar. Both birds show olive-green above and
yellow below, with no wing marks or other distinguishing
features, except the black cap worn
by the males. Some females carry this mark
faintly outlined, but it is lacking on the young.
The western bird is slightly larger.</p>
<p>During migration this warbler seems to prefer
low bushes and shrubs to the higher trees
and is found around parks or bushes bordering
streams. They seem friendly but move so rapidly
that you may miss the black cap. They combine
the usual warbler antics with those of small
flycatchers by capturing many flying insects;
however, they are not inclined to return to the
same perch, but hurry on their way.</p>
<p>The song is a rapid series of notes with
little variation except the last tones, which are
slightly lower in pitch. They nest on the ground
near water or swampy areas such as sphagnum
bogs of the north or alder and willow valleys of
the west.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That little cap</p>

<br /><i>Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="368" height="478" />
</div>
<p>Eastern birders are unfortunate for only on
rare occasions do they have a chance to see and
study this handsome bird. He is larger than the
Red-winged Blackbird, with which he often is
associated, but smaller than the Grackles. During
migration, they join other members of their
family in feed lots, pastures or fields and any
mixed flock is worth inspecting. They are identified
easily for no other bird has the black body,
white wing patch and yellow head and breast.
The female lacks wing markings and shows
dusky, grayish-brown coloring with a yellowish
tinge on lighter head markings. They walk with
almost a strut, as if they were proud of their
brilliant plumage.</p>
<p>Yellow-headed Blackbirds nest in colonies
and affix their bulky nests to tules and other
vegetation which grow in the center of marshes
and swamps in western areas. There seems to
be a tendency to move eastward, for a few are
nesting in the marshes of the upper Mississippi
valley.</p>
<p>Their song is distinctive and consists of a
series of chuckles, squeaks and grating notes,
all produced by what seems to be a great physical
effort. The results hardly justify such a
strain.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Icterus galbula</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="374" height="557" />
</div>
<p>Most people are attracted to birds by one of
3 things&mdash;their brilliant plumage, a beautiful
song or the way they build their nests. The Baltimore
Oriole scores in every department. Few
birds are more colorful than an adult male,
perched on the top of some tall tree, in full sunlight.
The rich-orange body glows like a living
ember. When you add the black of the head,
back, wings and central tail feathers, the white
wing bar and feather edging on the wings and
the orange outer feathers, near the end of the
tail, the contrasting pattern is unique. The female
and young are less colorful with dull black
and yellowish-orange markings and 2 distinct
wing bars.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Oriole&rsquo;s song is a rich melodious
whistle which varies slightly when given
by different birds, but retains the oriole quality.
It could be confused with songs of some of the
grosbeaks, but the latter use more &ldquo;chip&rdquo; notes
with their whistles. Western birders will find a
similar quality in the songs of Bullock&rsquo;s and
Scott&rsquo;s Orioles.</p>
<p>For nesting sites, they choose a spot near the
end of some drooping branch, where they construct
a deep, well-woven, gourd-shaped structure
which swings in the breeze. Grasses and
string furnish building material.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A lot of grass</p>

<br /><i>Quiscalus quiscula</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="389" height="529" />
</div>
<p>Almost everyone who lives or has traveled
any place east of the Rocky Mountains has seen
this bird. The chances are they call it a blackbird,
for most people do. From his appearance,
they are right. Since there are a number of different
species of blackbirds, this one should be
examined more closely. When you see him walking
around your yard, you will notice he is
larger than a Robin, has a wedge-shaped tail
and yellow eyes. The male often shows a keel-shaped
tail, when flying. The plumage is iridescent
and may show green, blue or purple.
Those who live along the Atlantic coast refer to
these birds as Purple Grackles, a name which
is becoming popular for both the eastern and
western types.</p>
<p>Grackles gather in huge flocks and can do
much damage to unharvested crops. In mixed
flocks, grackles show a more even flight pattern
than most blackbirds.</p>
<p>Other birds are not happy when grackles nest
in their area for these birds are inclined to add
both eggs and young of smaller birds to their
diet. Credit must be given the grackle, however,
for he mixes numerous insects with his diet of
fruit and grain.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We watch you dunking</p>

<h3 id="c43">Blue Grosbeak
<br /><i>Guiraca caerulea</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="396" height="570" />
</div>
<p>Many birders seem to have trouble in listing
the Blue Grosbeak. One reason is the size, for
they are smaller than most members of this
family. Another reason is that light conditions
often make them appear black. A third reason
might be their choice of habitat. They prefer
brushy areas near some stream, but may be
found along woodland borders or hedges, where
ample brush is found. They usually nest in low
trees or shrubs. There you probably will find
the male as he sings from the top of some bush
or even utility wire which crosses his territory.
You can see he is a deep, but rather dull blue,
with 2 chestnut wing bars. The female is brown
and shows 2 buffy wing bars. Both show a heavy
beak which gives them their name.</p>
<p>Blue Grosbeaks nest from Maryland to California
but shun the northern states. They winter
as far south as Honduras and are fonder of
warm weather than most members of their
family.</p>
<p>The Blue Grosbeak has a beautiful finch-like
song, using a short series of notes which rise
and fall into a sweet warble. It is slower than
the song of the Purple Finch and does not carry
like the usual grosbeak song. Their food consists
of insects and small seeds or grain.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The male is blue,</p>

<br /><i>Spinus pinus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="404" height="487" />
</div>
<p>Pine Siskins are unpredictable. Some years
they are numerous, while others produce few,
if any, in the same area. Food supply is not necessarily
the answer, for they are erratic wanderers.
These small finches seem to prefer conifers
for nesting. They build a neat structure,
using grass, bark or moss with a lining of finer
materials. Their home is well hidden by the
heavy foliage near the end of a limb. The eggs
are a pale bluish-green, dotted with brown or
black markings, more colorful than the pale
blue eggs of the American Goldfinch.</p>
<p>Siskins resemble goldfinches in their notes,
flocking habits and size, but can be identified by
the uniform, striped appearance. They have
semi-concealed yellow patches near the body on
both wings and tail. Goldfinches show clear
breasts in any plumage. Birders have found the
best clue to the identity of this bird is the long
buzzy note which forms a part of his song. His
notes are husky in quality.</p>
<p>In winter siskins mingle with other finches in
harvesting weed seeds. Other food consists of
seeds of various trees such as ash, birch or elms,
together with leaf buds. Most of their summer
is spent in evergreens which offer not only the
nesting sites but food necessary for growing
families.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That buzzy note</p>

<br /><i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="451" height="477" />
</div>
<p>Towhees inhabit thickets, bushes and brushy
areas, and spend most of their time scratching
thru litter which covers the ground in such locations.
When disturbed, they usually utter the
call note which gave them their name. Opinions
differ as to sounds made, so these birds are referred
to as &ldquo;Towhees,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jorees&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chewinks.&rdquo;
Some call them &ldquo;Ground Robins,&rdquo; since they
feed on the ground and a part of their plumage
resembles that of our Robins.</p>
<p>Towhees are smaller than Robins. The male
shows 3 distinct colors; the head, throat, back,
wings and tail are black; sides are rusty, and
the belly, outer tips of the tail and wing spots
are white. The female is browner but easily
identified by the color pattern. Western birds
are called Spotted Towhees, since their wings
and backs show more white feathers. Both have
red eyes. Those who do their birding along the
coast from South Carolina to Florida will find
birds with lighter irises and referred to as
White-eyed Towhees.</p>
<p>These birds nest on the ground but do most
of their singing from tops of trees. Songs vary
and may include a series of notes or 1 or 2 notes
followed by a trill.</p>

<br /><i>Pooecetes gramineus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="347" height="486" />
</div>
<p>Several kinds of sparrows can be found in
open fields, along roadside fences and hedgerows,
but the Vesper Sparrow is easiest to
identify. If you should miss the chestnut patch
on the bend of the wing or the white belly, bordered
by fine lines, you still will notice the white
outer-tail feathers. The back is a light grayish-brown
with dark stripes.</p>
<p>Juncos and pipits also have white outer-tail
feathers, but adult juncos show no stripes and
pipits walk instead of hop. Western Vesper
Sparrows show less brown in their plumage,
some being almost a light gray, but still show
darker lines on their backs, sides and breasts.</p>
<p>These birds use grass and small roots in building
their nests, which usually are in or near a
clump of grass. Their eggs are grayish white,
heavily marked with brown.</p>
<p>Vesper Sparrows are good singers. Their best
efforts seem to be late in the evening, when
dusk replaces the fleeting shadows; their musical
notes add a fitting benediction to the dying
day. This chorus accounts for the name. Songs
vary, but usually start with 2 pairs of long
melodious notes, the second pair higher in pitch,
then a series of rapid notes beginning still
higher, then coming down the scale to end in a
soft warble.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You might have been a junco</p>

<h3 id="c47">Lark Sparrow
<br /><i>Chondestes grammacus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="350" height="443" />
</div>
<p>These large sparrows are easily identified. No
other sparrow has a white border around the
tail or the distinctive chestnut and white head
pattern. Another mark is a distinct, dark spot
on the breast. Clay-colored Sparrows show a
similar head pattern but lighter parts are grayer
and the cheek patch is duller, more brown than
chestnut. The latter-named bird has no spot on
the breast.</p>
<p>Lark Sparrows prefer open areas along country
roads, old orchards or pastures with scattered
trees or bushy hedges. Such habitat furnishes
nesting sites and a plentiful supply of
insects, small seeds and grit for their use. Altho
usually a common species within its range,
these birds are inclined to be erratic and might
be scarce one season and abundant the next,
with no apparent reason.</p>
<p>They nest on or near the ground but like to
sing from a more elevated perch such as a fence,
bush or tree. Some sing while hovering in the
air. They cover a wide range but populations
vary from year to year.</p>
<p>Their song is a series of melodious notes, varying
in pitch but seeming to include a few
&ldquo;churrs&rdquo; which are quite distinctive. Songs vary
between birds, each bird giving a wide variety
of notes in a short period of time.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Spizella passerina</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="316" height="453" />
</div>
<p>Chipping Sparrows are not only the friendliest,
but one of the best-known American sparrows.
The reason is apparent, for yards, gardens
and parks furnish ideal habitat for these
birds. They often nest in vines or bushes just
outside your window. Nesting materials include
grasses, rootlets and hairs, horsehair being used
extensively, when available. Their fondness for
a horsehair lining in the nest sometimes leads
to casualties when either parents or young become
entangled.</p>
<p>Chippies derive their name from their songs,
a series of chip notes which they utter. This is a
rapid, unmusical series of notes, all on the
same pitch. They frequently join the Robins to
start the day with song. Juncos and some of the
warblers also use a series of chip notes in their
songs, but with more variations and more musical
in quality.</p>
<p>They feed heavily on insects and larvae, including
various caterpillars, beetles, ants and
plant lice. Vegetable food amounts to a little
more than half their diet and includes seeds
from grasses and weeds. Crab grass seeds seem
to be a favorite.</p>
<p>Western Chipping Sparrows are slightly
larger and paler but show the rusty cap, black
beak and other markings which are distinctive.</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>White-crowned Sparrows are known only as
migrants or winter residents to birders living
east of the Great Plains. Westerners are more
fortunate for White-crowns and the similar
Gambel&rsquo;s and Nuttall&rsquo;s Sparrows nest in much
of their area. When flushed from their feeding
grounds, these birds will impress you by their
alert appearance. The habit of erecting the
crown feathers makes the head appear round
and puffy, and brings out the beauty of the
broad black and white stripes which surround
the white crown.</p>
<p>These birds have a gray throat and breast, 2
wing bars, grayish-brown backs with darker
stripes. The feet and bill are pinkish. A white
line over the eye of the White-crowned Sparrow
does not extend to the beak, as it does on Gambel&rsquo;s
and Nuttall&rsquo;s. Nuttall&rsquo;s Sparrow has a
yellow bill.</p>
<p>White-throated Sparrows often are found in
mixed flocks with White-crowns, but the former
show a distinct white throat patch, have
flatter heads, and a yellow spot between the
bill and eye. The beak is dark.</p>
<p>White-crowned Sparrows are good singers.
Their songs vary but usually start with a clear
but plaintive whistle. Western varieties sing differently
but have a similar quality.</p>

<p>Song Sparrows literally sang themselves into
a name, for few birds sing so persistently. To
Thoreau these birds seemed to say: &ldquo;Maids!
maids! maids! hang up your teakettle-ettle-ettle.&rdquo;
To you it may sound differently, but you
still will hear the sharp notes with which he
starts his song. These are on the same pitch
with a slight pause between each note. From
there, the song is variable and may contain
trills or assorted notes on various pitches. One
bird may produce several different songs.</p>
<p>These birds prefer brushy or weedy areas
near water but may nest near your home if a
bird bath is handy. No other bird seems to take
as much pleasure from bathing.</p>
<p>There are numerous geographic forms of this
bird, which accounts for wide variation in colors
and sizes. The Desert Song Sparrow is light
while others are almost as rusty as Fox Sparrows.
All Song Sparrows are heavily striped,
and show a distinct spot in the center of the
breast, and a dark line on each side of the
throat. There is a gray stripe thru the crown
and a broader line over the eyes.</p>
<p>They usually migrate in March and October
but wintering birds often are found in the nesting

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="453" height="439" />
</div>
<p>Lapland Longspurs are birds of the far north,
nesting as they do in the arctic and sub-arctic
regions of both eastern and western hemispheres.
They visit us only in the winter when
deep snow and bitter cold drive them from their
homes. Flocks of these sparrow-sized birds may
be found in open fields, prairies and pastures,
feeding on whatever seed or small grain is available.
They run rapidly, ever on the search for
more food, and may be joined by Horned Larks
at good feeding spots.</p>
<p>They seem nervous and take wing frequently,
circle here and there and often return to the
same location. They have a rolling, erratic flight
which reminds one of blowing leaves.</p>
<p>In breeding plumage these birds display a lot
of color. The male has a black head and chest,
rufous nape, back and sides heavily striped and
a white belly. A buffy stripe behind the eye
drops down the neck and backward along the
sides of the chest. In winter you will see a
brownish bird with blackish streaks and white
under parts.</p>
<p>In their eagerness to return to their northern
homes, Lapland Longspurs often suffer heavy
losses because of wet spring snows. Their song
is varied and sweet.</p>
